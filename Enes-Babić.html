                        <!-- Post Content -->
                        <p>My name is Enes Babić, and I come from Croatia. Currently I live I Rijeka, but who know for
                            how long. I don’t really believe in “putting down roots” and tying oneself to one place.
                            Currently I have bachelor’s degree in business economics, and I currently for in a Tax
                            Consulting firm.
                            I have had interest in Web Development for a long time. For programing in general, but it
                            was always fun to think about and something I really wanted to learn, but whenever I
                            actually tried to learn, I would give up way to easy. Programing in general is an uphill
                            battle, and that hill is really steep, but once you get the hold of it, it is so rewarding,
                            and that feeling of success, that one element that shows up on screen, that one line of
                            code that fixes all your problems, it just gives you so much to feed from, and propels you
                            forward and it really hard to stop at one point. Currently besides web development I am
                            working on my Python knowledge. I really like Python as a programing language, it is easy
                            but so scalable and versatile. Other than that, I give it a go in Android Development, but
                            that didn’t last very long, but who knows, one day maybe I’ll go back to Android aps.
                        </p>

                        <p>Other than Web Development, I have a lot of interest in marketing and social media
                            marketing, as well as a bit of Graphic Design. This page will be actually my first project,
                            my testing grounds, who knows, maybe I actually have a future in this field.</p>
